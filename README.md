# keypad-software
Software for FunOrange's keypad. Use it to remap keys, customize lighting effects and more.

Note that this software is incompatible with the first batch of 40 keypads I sold in 2019.

This is a second iteration of this project: https://github.com/FunOrange/funorange-gaming-software
I decided to move away from Windows Forms and instead use WPF with Caliburn Micro.
